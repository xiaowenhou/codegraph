export const SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS = `# Codegraph — code intelligence over an indexed knowledge graph

Codegraph is a SQLite knowledge graph of every symbol, edge, and file in
the workspace — pre-computed structure you would otherwise re-derive by
reading files (cached intelligence: thousands of parse/trace decisions you
don't pay to re-reason each run). It indexes 30+ languages
(TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, C#, C/C++, PHP, Ruby, Swift,
Kotlin, and more) — don't assume a language here isn't covered. Reads are
sub-millisecond; the index lags writes by ~1s through the file watcher. Reach for it BEFORE *and* while
writing or editing code — not just for questions: one call returns the
verbatim source PLUS who calls it and what it affects, so you edit with the
blast radius in view. More accurate context, in far fewer tokens and
round-trips than reading files yourself.

## One tool: codegraph_explore — use it instead of reading files

There is a single tool, \`codegraph_explore\`, and it is Read-equivalent. It
takes either a natural-language question or a bag of symbol/file names and
returns the **verbatim, line-numbered source** of the relevant symbols
grouped by file — the same \`<n>\\t<line>\` shape \`Read\` gives you, safe to
\`Edit\` from — PLUS the call path among them (including dynamic-dispatch hops
like callbacks, React re-render, and JSX children that grep can't follow) and
a blast-radius summary of what depends on them.

Whether you're answering "how does X work" or implementing a change (fixing a
bug, adding a feature), call \`codegraph_explore\` before you Read. ONE call
usually answers the whole question. Codegraph IS the pre-built search index —
so running your own grep + read loop, or delegating the lookup to a separate
file-reading sub-task/agent, repeats work codegraph already did and costs more
for the same answer. A direct codegraph answer is typically one to a few
calls; a grep/read exploration is dozens.

## How to query

- **Almost any question — "how does X work", architecture, a bug, "what/where is X", or surveying an area** → \`codegraph_explore\` with a natural-language question or the relevant names. ONE capped call returns the verbatim source grouped by file; most often the ONLY call you need.
- **"How does X reach/become Y? / the flow / the path from X to Y"** → \`codegraph_explore\`, naming the symbols that span the flow (e.g. \`mutateElement renderScene\`) — it surfaces the call path among them, riding dynamic-dispatch hops, and returns their source.
- **Reading or editing a file/symbol you can name** → put its name or file path in the \`codegraph_explore\` query — it returns that current line-numbered source (safe to \`Edit\` from) with the call path and blast radius attached, so you don't Read it separately. For an overloaded name it returns every matching definition's body in one call.
- **Need more?** Call \`codegraph_explore\` again with more specific names — treat the source it returns as already Read.

## Anti-patterns

- **Trust codegraph's results — don't re-verify them with grep.** They come from a full AST parse; re-checking with grep is slower, less accurate, and wastes context.
- **Don't grep or Read first** to find or understand indexed code — ONE \`codegraph_explore\` returns the relevant symbols' source together in a single round-trip. Reach for raw \`Read\`/\`Grep\` only to confirm a specific detail codegraph didn't cover, or for what codegraph doesn't index (configs, docs).
- **Don't reconstruct a flow by hand** — name the endpoints in one \`codegraph_explore\` and it surfaces the path between them, dynamic-dispatch hops included.
- **After editing, check the staleness banner.** When a tool response starts with "⚠️ Some files referenced below were edited since the last index sync…", the listed files are pending re-index — Read those specific files for accurate content. Every file NOT in that banner is fresh, so still trust codegraph. A different, rarer banner — "⚠️ CodeGraph auto-sync is DISABLED…" — means live watching stopped entirely (the whole index is frozen, not just a few files); until it's resolved, Read files directly to confirm anything that may have changed.
- **A file flagged "⚠ changed on disk after the last index sync" drifted from its index** (most common on projects queried via \`projectPath\`, which have no live watcher). Codegraph never serves a possibly-mis-sliced body from such a file — it either shows the file's full CURRENT source (trust it as a Read) or omits the source with this flag. When the source was omitted, Read that specific file; line numbers referencing it elsewhere in the response may be shifted until that project's next sync. All unflagged files remain trustworthy.

- **"Already sent earlier in this conversation" is a pointer, not a gap.** When a file's section carries that line instead of (or above) its source, an earlier \`codegraph_explore\` in THIS conversation already returned those exact lines and the file has not changed since — so the copy already in your context is current and exact. Scroll back to it; don't re-fetch it and don't Read the file. The bytes it freed went into source you have not seen yet, elsewhere in the same response.

## Limitations

- If a tool reports a project isn't indexed (no \`.codegraph/\`), stop calling codegraph tools for that project for the rest of the session and use your built-in tools there instead. Indexing is the user's decision — mention they can run \`codegraph init\` if it comes up, but don't run it yourself.
- Index lags file writes by ~1 second.
- Cross-file resolution is best-effort name matching; ambiguous calls may return multiple candidates.
- No live correctness validation — that's still the TypeScript compiler / test suite / linter's job. Codegraph supplements those with structural context they don't have.

/**
 * Instructions variant sent when the server's own root has NO codegraph index.

 * The tools are still exposed (gating tool availability on whether `./` has an
 * index is the bug behind #964: it breaks monorepos where only sub-projects are
 * indexed, and a server that started before `codegraph init` never surfaces the
 * tools afterward). Instead of an "inactive" note, this variant tells the agent
 * codegraph works **per project**: there's no default project to query, so pass

export const SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS_NO_ROOT_INDEX = `# Codegraph — available (per-project; pass projectPath)

Codegraph is a SQLite knowledge graph of a codebase's symbols, edges, and
files (30+ languages): one \`codegraph_explore\` call returns the verbatim, line-numbered source
of the relevant symbols PLUS the call paths between them and a blast-radius
summary — replacing a grep + Read loop with one round-trip.

This server started somewhere with no \`.codegraph/\` of its own, so there is no
default project — but the tools are available and work **per project**:

- To query a project that HAS a \`.codegraph/\` index (e.g. a service inside a
  monorepo, or a second repo), pass its path as \`projectPath\` to
  \`codegraph_explore\` (and any other codegraph tool). Codegraph resolves the
  nearest \`.codegraph/\` at or above that path and answers from it — for as many
  projects as you like in one session.
- For a project with no \`.codegraph/\`, use your built-in tools (Read/Grep/Glob)
  for that project. Indexing is the user's decision — don't run it yourself, but
  if it comes up they can run \`codegraph init\` in a project to enable codegraph
  there (a new index is picked up live, no restart).
